## HOW TO CREATE A STABLE URL FOR A .pdf FILE USING GitHub PAGES ##

To create a GitHub page URL to link a .pdf file, first create the ground following these steps:
  1. create a GitHub repository, and then go to its section called "“Settings”, and then, on the left border, to “Pages”";
  2. In the section called "Build and deployment":
     - in _source_, select "deploy from a branch";
     - in _branch_, select the "main (or master)", "/(root)", and click on “save”;
  3. now, wait till the setup is done. You can check the status under _https://<your_username>.github.io/<repository_name>_. After the 404 error is gone, it is online.

Then, to create a URL that directly links to a .pdf file, one should: 
  1. go to the repositories by clicking the profile image at top-right, and select "your repositories";
  2. open the desired repository where the file should be stored;
  3. in the "main" section, click "add file", and select the given file to upload. Then:
     - note that a file cannot be deleted unless you delete the repository;
     - to substitute a file, simply upload a file with the same name, and this will take the place of the old file;
  4. this will automatically create an URL as the following _https://<your_username>.github.io/<repository_name>/<path/to/file.pdf>_;
  5. then, write the correct URL in a search tab on your preferred broswer to check that everything is fine!
